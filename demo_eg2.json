In the process of checking the cameras I discovered that she has been taking food/drinks to my bedroom and sleeping there during the night and most of the day all weekend. \n\nPersonally I have house/animal watched several times over the years and have NEVER slept/ate/drink in the owners bedroom. \n\nSo now my question is AITA considering she does not live there and have just decided to do whatever they want?\n\nEdit- additional info\n*she was paid to watch the dog*", "processed_comments": [{"comment_id": "iubfd8d", "comment_content_vector": [0, 0, 0, 0], "comment_quality_vector": [1, 1, 3, 3, 5], "reasoning": "Only asks a clarifying question about expectations; makes no claims about harm, intent, empathy, or apology.
