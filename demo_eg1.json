My friend's sister (E) is really weird. She'll just stare at me and when she realizes I notice she'll run off. I can't wear certain perfumes at their house because it's apparently too strong for E. \n\nOnce E took the strings out of my hoodie so she could play with them. Apparently she thought the hoodie was hers even though she's seen me wear it multiple times. I once put some of my pads in their bathroom and I found out later that E had thrown them all away. E has also walked in on me several times when I'm using the bathroom. S & E share a bathroom and their parents removed the lock after an incident with E. It's super creepy and I've told E to knock several times.\n\nWell this past Saturday E walked in on me again. The worst part was that she didn't leave right away. It was like she was a deer in headlights. I was so pissed y'all. I called her a creep and slammed the door shut. Just to be clear, I made sure the door wouldn't hit E before I shut it. Apparently this was very upsetting as she started having one of her famous meltdowns. \n\nTheir mom was quick to respond and I tried to explain my side of the story. E's mom wasn't having it and even after S came to my defense I was told I would have to leave. Their mom told my mom an unfavorable account of the events. Apparently I'm antagonistic to E and I won't be allowed back over for awhile. My mom agreed with their mom's response. So now I'm 2nd guessing everything I ever did to E and wondering if I overreacted. Also, E is 10 so she's not like some toddler who doesn't know better.\n\nEdit: I'm 15, S is 14, and E is on the spectrum", "processed_comments": [{"comment_id": "ivk5103", "comment_content_vector": [0, 0, 0, 0], "comment_quality_vector": [2, 1, 3, 3, 4], "reasoning": "The comment only asks for information about disabilities and makes no claims about OP\u2019s behavior or need to apologize.
